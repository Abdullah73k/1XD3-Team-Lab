			<h2>2. Purpose</h2>
			<p>
				Our app is going to be a calendar/time management app. The target users
				are students/employees looking to organize their schedule. They are
				likely to be mobile users, so the site should be designed with narrower
				widths first and foremost, although desktop users do need some
				consideration. The app should allow users to add as many tasks/events as
				they want and be able to see when/where they are set to happen. They
				should also be able to view deadlines for projects, and be able to track
				their progress.
			</p>

			<h2>8. Client Feedback</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					“Since students and office workers usually organize their schedules on
					their phones, I'm satisfied with making an app in a mobile size. I
					also like organizing my schedule in a calendar format, and it's
					convenient to manage and update my to-do lists within the calendar.
					But can you add a timer feature as well? I want to set deadlines for
					my tasks each day so I can visually see how much time I have left to
					complete my work.”
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Client wants us to add a timer in our app in order to manage the users
				work efficiently.
