				<p class="bad-design-text">
					This website is highly inconsistent as it does not follow a general
					style or design pattern. All of the links and content elements on the
					page are randomly placed without much thought or organization. The
					color scheme of the website is also inconsistent, as it uses colors
					that clash and do not complement each other. In terms of
					responsiveness, the website has no responsiveness at all. When the
					screen size decreases, the elements do not adjust accordingly.
					Instead, they either stay the same size, causing layout issues, or
					completely disappear, resulting in an incomplete or unusable
					interface. The ease of navigation is also non-existent. Links are
					scattered randomly across the page without any logical order, forcing
					users to scroll through the entire site and hope they find what they
					are looking for. There is no clear structure or intuitive design for
					navigation. Additionally, the site contains multiple errors. For
					example, none of the images load properly, which leaves the site
					looking incomplete and unprofessional. This demonstrates a lack of
					attention to detail and a failure to follow proper development
					practices.
